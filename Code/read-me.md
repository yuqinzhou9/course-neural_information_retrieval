To use the code in this file, one should first download the relevant dataset. They should then run each juypter notebook in order, as the first two notebooks created indexers for the following research (remember to modify the relevant path of files). 

For the results of the training or test sets, one can load the runs from the "reretreival runs" or view them directly on the third and fourth juyper nootbook.

The code is messy, thanks for your patience :)
